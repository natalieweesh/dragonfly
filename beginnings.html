          <p>Founders Lieng-Seng WEE and Judy LEE were pioneers in developing risk management know-how from the late 1980s in New York.</p>
          <p>They were also leading practitioners helping build and run the Global Risk Management function at Bankers Trust in New York.</p>

        <p>WEE and LEE each bring over two decades of experience as risk management and strategy practitioners with strong expertise and hands-on knowledge in banking, derivatives, capital markets, and corporate finance.</p>
        <p>WEE and LEE have developed a unique and powerful approach to strategy development and investment analysis using comprehensive risk identification and quantification, structuring of risk-return tradeoffs and valuation techniques under uncertainty.
